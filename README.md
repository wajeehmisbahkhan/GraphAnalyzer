# Graph Analyzer

In this project, we implement the following algorithms from Graph Analysis using given benchmarks of increasing number of nodes (from 10 nodes to 100 nodes).

## Basic Overview

Basically, we need to show a very nice user interface where a user can select any input files to display a graph using x and y co-ordinates provided for each node in each input file. Once displayed, then the user should able to run the following algorithms.

## Instructions

For Prims, Kruskal & Clustering Coefficient in Graph Theory, if there is a link between two nodes, then consider this as edge in undirected graph. If there are two directed link b/w edges, then consider the edge with minimum cost.

1. Prims
2. Kruskal
3. Dijkstra
4. Bellman Ford
5. Floyd Warshall Algorithm
6. Clustering Coefficient in Graph Theory (Only Local Clustering).The final cost should be the average of all local clustering of all nodes

## Cloning

Run `npm install` to install all the packages and `npm start` to run it locally.
